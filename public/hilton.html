      <h3>Hilton Hanoi Opera and Hilton Garden Inn Hanoi Partner with Better Life Vietnam</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">to Extend Opportunities to Young People</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>HANOI, Vietnam – September 18, 2017</strong> – Better Life Vietnam (BLV), together with Hilton Hanoi Opera and Hilton Garden Inn Hanoi, today announced their collaboration to offer more learning and development opportunities for young people in Vietnam. In this partnership, both Hilton hotels in Hanoi will provide funding support and hospitality careers workshop for five recipients of the Disadvantaged Youth Scholarship run by BLV, a non-profit that works to improve education conditions for underprivileged children and youth in Vietnam.

“Our partnership with Better Life Vietnam bears testament to Hilton’s commitment to connect, prepare and employ at least one million young people by 2019,” said Andrew Nisbet, Cluster General Manger for Hilton Hanoi Opera and Hilton Garden Inn Hanoi. “Guided by our mission to be the most hospitable company in the world, we remain dedicated to work with local community organizations and participate in the progress and development of our local community.”

“At BLV, we want the whole family involved and committed to working for a brighter future,” says Thinh Nguyen, Founder of Better Life Vietnam. “It’s more than just receiving financial support for school expenses. We conduct interviews, review student school records and require the family to propose an income-generating model such as raising chickens or growing organic vegetables to ensure they are set up for a sustainable future before selecting our recipients. It’s a spiritual gift filled with hope and belief in a better life for our students and their families.”

Recipients of the Disadvantaged Youth Scholarship have been selected based on their excellent academic performance in school. In addition to getting support for their continued education in school, the students will also have a chance to learn more about careers in the hospitality during the year. Through on-site visits, hand-on experience and chances to connect with tourism and hospitality professionals at the Hilton hotels in Hanoi, the students will gain better insights and access to developing a career in the hospitality industry.

Furthermore, families whose child is part of the scholarship would also be positively impacted. Families that run a farming business stand a chance to have their agricultural produce reviewed and considered as a source of food supply for both hotels.
